My C++ library for STM32F0, STM32F4 and BlueNRG-2. Some peripherial parts are implemented from scratch bypassing CubeMX, and some are only an object oriented abstraction over it. My loose idea is to make easy to use OO abstraction for most of the STM32 peripherals for be able to unit test them on a PC to some extent someday. For now I use it in my various hobby and commercial projects. It's my own toolkit basically.
